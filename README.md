# 🕌 7al — Islamic Prayer Discord Bot

**7al** is an Islamic Discord bot designed to help Muslims stay connected to their daily prayers through **voice reminders** and **visual prayer schedules**.

## ✨ Features

### 🔊 Prayer Voice Reminders

7al automatically reminds users shortly before each prayer.

* Automatically detects **active voice channels**
* Joins voice channels that currently contain members
* Announces when there are **5 minutes remaining until Adhan**
* Supports all **five daily prayers**:

  * Fajr
  * Dhuhr
  * Asr
  * Maghrib
  * Isha
* Leaves the voice channel after the reminder is finished

### 🖼️ Daily Prayer Times Image

Users can request a visual schedule containing the day's prayer times.

* Generates a clean and beautiful **prayer time image**
* Clearly displays the daily prayer schedule
* Can be requested directly through a Discord command
* Perfect for sharing in server text channels

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The bot calculates prayer times based on the configured location.
2. It continuously checks the upcoming prayer time.
3. **5 minutes before Adhan**, the bot:

   * Finds voice channels containing active members
   * Joins the relevant voice channels
   * Plays an audio reminder
4. Users can also request an image containing the full daily prayer schedule.
